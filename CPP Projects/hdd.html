Wasted Space<br>
<br>
The wasted space is the amount of space in clusters on you harddisk, that
are not entirely filled. Keep the following formula in mind: size + wasted
space = allocated space. Windows 95 with its file system FAT may have very
large cluster sizes, dependent on the partition size:<br>
<br>
<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; FAT &nbsp;&nbsp; FAT32<br>
<br>
Partition Size &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cluster Size &nbsp;&nbsp;
Partition Size &nbsp;&nbsp; Cluster Size<br>
128 - 256 MB &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 4 KB &nbsp;&nbsp; 1 - 8 GB &nbsp;&nbsp;
4 KB<br>
257 - 512 MB &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8 KB &nbsp;&nbsp; 8 - 16 GB &nbsp;&nbsp;
8 KB &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>
513 - 1024 MB &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 16 KB &nbsp;&nbsp; 16 - 32 GB &nbsp;&nbsp;
16 KB<br>
1025 - 2048 MB &nbsp; &nbsp; 32 KB &nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;32 GB &nbsp;&nbsp; 32
KB<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Partitions larger than 2GB are not possible with FAT. If you for example
have a single partition on a 1.2GB harddisk, you have a cluster size of 32KB
on it. If you store 10 files of 1 KB on this partition, this would use 10*32KB=320KB
of your precious harddisk space, and 320KB-10KB=310KB would be wasted. Especially
a huge number of small files significantly increase the amount of wasted
space on FAT partitions.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
To reduce the wasted space, there are the following possibilities: <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&middot; &nbsp;&nbsp; Make smaller partitions. Don't make partitions larger
than 1024MB using FAT, because partitions larger than 1024MB will have a
cluster size of 32KB and a lot of wasted space. People reported wasted space
up to 25% on 2GB partitions. Of course smaller partitions will increase the
number of drive letters.<br>
<br>
&middot; &nbsp;&nbsp; Use FAT32 instead of FAT to format your partitions,
because it operates with smaller clusters. FAT32 is&nbsp; incompatible to
the old FAT file system, so be careful using old disk repair utilities on
it. You cannot access FAT32 partitions with Windows NT4.<br>
<br>
<br>
&middot; &nbsp;&nbsp; Windows NT/2000 provides the possibility to format
your harddisk with the NTFS file system. It usually operates with 512 byte
clusters and has the best storage efficiency of all Windows file systems.
NTFS partitions cannot be accessed from Windows 9x or DOS without use of
3rd party software. In addition, NTFS can compress selected directory branches.
The compression is invisible for applications and you don't need a new drive
letter like with the DriveSpace software.<br>
